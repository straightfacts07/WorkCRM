//steps to actually start
//i need to first install django after each push i do because u know github wont store that
//step 1=python -m venv django_env
//step 2- django_env\Scripts\activate
//step 3= pip install django
//step 4 =cd homecrm
//step 5=  python manage.py runserver 
its lowkey better to add all the steps in requirement but again we only need django and that need to be DONE
after pushing this all on github
